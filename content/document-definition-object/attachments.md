pdfmake supports attaching files as annotations as well as embedded files.
Embedded files are added in the "files" dictionary and will show up in supported pdf viewers in their respective attachment panels.
File attachments are annotations which link to a file.
Any attachment or embedded file must provide at least a "src", providing a filename through "name" is highly recommended.
The "src" of any attachment can be provided in dataURL format (like the following attachment, taken from http://www.clipartbest.com/clipart-dT7zx5rT9), but local files are allowed as well.

```js
var dd = {
	content: [
		'Any attachment or embedded file must provide at least a "src", providing a filename through "name" is highly recommended.',
